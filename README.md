# Descriptive Statistics Project: sales analysis of real estate in Texas

Hello everyone, thank you for being here! :blush:

This is a project concerning the descriptive analysis of sales of real estate in Texas :house_with_garden:. 

I used the dataset present in the `realestate_texas.csv` file. This consists of 240 observables of 8 variables, which give us information about the sales per month of the real estates of Beaumont, Bryan-College Station, Tyler and Wichita Falls, from 2010 to 2014. Going into detail, the variables are:

* `city`: reference city;
* `year`: reference year;
* `month`: reference month;
* `sales`: total number of sales;
* `listings`: total number of active listings;
* `volume`: total value of sales in millions of dollars;
* `median_price`: median sale price in dollars; 
* `months_inventory`: amount of time required to sell all the active listings at the current sales rate, in months.

I described the features of the data set, by generating, according to the variable under consideration, frequency distribution tables or summaries containing the measures of position, the measures of variability and the measures of shape. Furthermore, to better visualize trends and patterns in data, I graphically represented them, mainly using the `ggplot2` package.
